ðŸ“… Scheduling Tool

Welcome to the Scheduling Tool! This project is a simple yet functional example of a scheduling application, designed to demonstrate core concepts without excessive complexity.

ðŸš€ Quick Setup

Setting up this project is as easy as it gets:

Download or Clone the repository.

Run the application â€“ no extra setup required!

Since this is an example project, all data is stored in a local file instead of an SQL database. This was done for scope and time reasons, but I plan to improve it by integrating a full database in the future.

ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Easy-to-use scheduling functionalityâœ… Simple file-based data storageâœ… Quick setup â€“ just download & runâœ… Future plans for SQL integration

Feel free to explore, modify, and improve! ðŸš€
